* 	Queries 
	MyModel.order_by(MyModel.created_at)
	MyModel.order_by(db.desc(MyModel.created_at))
	  To order the results by a given attribute. Use db.desc to order in descending order.
	  
	Join
	Driver.query.join('vehicles')
	Query has a method join(<table_name>) for joining one model to another table.

	print(Person.query.filter(Person.name.like('%my%')).all());
	
* SQLAlchemy Object Lifecycle	
	Within a session, we create transactions every time we want to commit work to the database.
	Proposed changes are not immediately committed to the database and instead go through stages to allow for undos.
	The ability to undo is allowed via db.session.rollback()
	Stages:
	Transient: an object exists, it was defined.

	user1 = User(name='Amy')
	...but not attached to a session (yet).

	Pending: an object was attached to a session. "Undo" becomes available via db.session.rollback(). Waits for a flush to happen

	Flushed: about ready to be committed to the database, translating actions into SQL command statements for the engine.

	Committed: manually called for a change to persist to the database (permanently); session's transaction is cleared for a new set of changes.
